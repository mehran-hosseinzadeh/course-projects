# My Selected Course Code Samples
This is a repository with some sample codes from my academic courses. These samples include:
- **Advanced Computer Vision HW5**, where I have implemented image template matching and point cloud alignment,
- **Deep Learning HW1**, where I have implemented an MLP model using NumPy from scratch,
-  **Deep Learning HW2**, which is a sample ResNet architecture used on CIFAR10 dataset.
-  **Deep Learning HW4**, which contains my implementations of a VAE, GAN, and a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) on MNIST dataset,
- **Deep Learning HW5**, which includes an implementation of Deep-Q Network (DQN) on the Cart-Pole-v1 environment,
- **Machine Learning Project**, which applied sentiment analysis to a given text data,
-  **Modern Information Retrieval HW2**, which had my implemented text classification and clustering on text data,
- **Modern Information Retrieval HW3**, which is a scraper (crawler) in Python on papers from Semantic Scholar, plus ElasticSearch interfaces, PageRank, HITS (Hyperlink_Induced Topic Search), and query search.

A simple sports website as my project for web programming course is also located in my **Web-Project** repository.
